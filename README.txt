This folder contains all of the source, all of the labels, and all of the scripts necessary to train the models associated with this paper.

/src contains all of the source code needed to train and inference the ML models presented as baselines in this paper
/scripts contains all of the scripts and slurm jobfiles needed to run the training pipelines for the ML models presented as baselines in this paper
/data contains all of the annotations released as part of this dataset. These labels are to be combined with the imagery already hosted online at https://huggingface.co/datasets/CRASAR/CRASAR-U-DROIDs

The file "Baseline Model Training - Details.csv" contains the hardware details for all of the model training runs used to establish the baseline models.

The file "requirements.txt" contains all of the python dependencies that were used in this work. All dependencies can be install with the command "pip install -r requirements.txt"

The baseline models themselves will be made available upon publication as the models themselves are too large to include in these materials.
